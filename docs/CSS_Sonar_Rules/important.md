The `!important` annotation is used to artificially increase the specificity of a given property value in a rule. This is usually an indication that the specificity of the entire CSS has gotten a bit out of control and needs to be refactored. The more frequently `!important` is found in CSS, the more likely it is that developers are having trouble styling parts of a page effectively.
